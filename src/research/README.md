# `/src/research` — groundwork for section 21

Section 21 (LLM-assisted research and bot proposals) is **PLANNED, NOT YET
BUILT**, and that banner still holds. There is no pipeline, no prompt, no
proposal record, no Workers AI call and no endpoint in this folder.

What exists is the storage for **21.3's fixed watchlist**, and a read path for a
pipeline stage that does not exist yet.

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `watchlist.ts` | `addToWatchlist` / `removeFromWatchlist` / `readWatchlist`: the deliberate half of candidate selection, over `watchlist` (migration 0008) |

## The two candidate sources stay apart

21.3 feeds the general entry point from two sources, and this folder holds one
of them:

1. **A fixed watchlist** — 5–10 coins *chosen deliberately by the operators*.
2. **A live trending pull** — *the only way the system can ever surface
   something the operators did not already think to look for*.

**The trending pull must never write to the `watchlist` table.** The merge is
tempting because both produce pairs and both feed one pipeline (21.2: "one
feature, not two"), and it is still wrong twice over:

- 21.5 requires every proposal to display *the real source the candidate came
  from — which watchlist entry, or which trending pull, and when*. One table
  destroys that distinction at the moment of writing, and nothing downstream
  recovers it.
- 21.3's **hype hazard**: trending measures attention, not quality. A watchlist
  entry carries a human's stated reason (`note`, NOT NULL); a trending hit
  carries a popularity number. Stored together they are indistinguishable to
  every later reader, which is how a proposal comes to read as confident because
  its input was loud.

The cap makes the merge unattractive as well as forbidden: a trending pull
emptying itself into a 10-row table fails on the eleventh coin.

## What a write checks

| Check | Why | On failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Human actor | The list's value is that someone chose each row | `requires_human_actor` |
| Non-blank pair and note | The note is the only record of the reasoning | `missing_field` |
| Not already live | A duplicate is one coin costing two pipeline runs | `already_watched` |
| `WATCHLIST_MAX_ENTRIES` (10) | 21.3's bound, enforced not documented | `cap_exceeded` |
| Tradable on the account's venue | An untradable coin cannot become a bot | `pair_not_tradable` |
| The tradable set was **readable** | "could not check" ≠ "checked and fine" (§5.6) | `tradable_set_unreadable` |

The tradable set comes from `listTradablePairs` through step 11's cached
`listAccountSymbols`, injected as the `TradablePairSource` port — 21.3 is
explicit that it "is the authority, not a hardcoded list", and there is no
second path to the venue here.

Every write also lands an `audit_log` row through `db.auditLog`, the same path
every other consequential write in this system uses. The add batches its row and
its audit entry together; the removal does not, deliberately — see the comment
at that call site.

## Removal does not re-check tradability

Deliberate, and a departure from applying the write-side rule symmetrically.
Refusing to remove a **delisted** pair would trap exactly the entry most in need
of removing, and an exchange outage would be enough to freeze the list. The
failure runs the wrong way. Removal checks the precondition that actually
matters — that the pair is on the live list — and audits itself.

## Removal is a soft delete

`removed_at` / `removed_by`, not a row deletion. `Repository` offers no `delete`
method at all (see `/src/db/table.ts`) and this does not reach past it. Step 26
established the shape for `bot_instances.archived`; this is the same one table
over. The history is worth keeping on its own terms: *someone considered this
coin and then changed their mind* is the same kind of negative signal 21.5 wants
recorded about proposals nobody acted on.

## Deliberately deferred

- **A dashboard control for editing the list.** Not built, on purpose. Editing
  is `wrangler d1 execute` for now.
- **Candidate selection, the trending pull, `getCandles` for arbitrary pairs,
  and everything LLM-shaped.** None of it exists.
- **Any API endpoint.** Nothing here is reachable over HTTP.

`readWatchlist` currently has **no caller**. It is the seam the pipeline will
consume.

## What the manual edit path bypasses

While editing is a raw `wrangler d1 execute`, the cap, the tradability check and
the audit entry are all bypassed — none of that code runs on a raw `INSERT`. The
one guarantee that survives is the migration's unique partial index on
`(account_label, pair) WHERE removed_at IS NULL`. This is stated rather than
hidden; it is the strongest argument for building the dashboard control, and the
reason the SQL commands in the decision log write the paired `audit_log` row by
hand.
